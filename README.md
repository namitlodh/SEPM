LOCAL TRAIN TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM
Local Train Ticket Booking System is basically concerned with the reservation of 
local train tickets to the passengers of metropolitan cities. This Ticket Booking 
system is completely coded in C Programming language. This system ensures the 
user to view trains of his desired destination, Reserve the ticket, Cancel the ticket 
etc. This System mainly used in the Travelling Agency who provide the train 
ticket reservation to passengers. It can also be used in Android devices also. The 
existing system is highly manual involving people standing in queue and waiting 
to get a ticket and also involving lot of paper work and calculation and therefore 
may be erroneous. This has lead to inconsistency and wastage of time of 
passengers. To overcome this problem we have designed a computerized system. 
The computerization of booking a ticket will reduce a lot of time and also reduce 
the load of paperwork on administrative staff. These system is designed in such a 
way that passenger can book a ticket as well as cancel the ticket of any train he 
wants to take.
